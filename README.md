# NOTIP: Non-parametric True Discovery Proportion control for brain imaging

This repository contains the code to reproduce all experiments of the paper (METTRE LIEN VERS ARTICLE).
Note that the first time you run one of those scripts, the fMRI data fetching from Neurovault will take place, which takes a significant amount of time. This only needs to be done once.

### Installing dependencies

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
